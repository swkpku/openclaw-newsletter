    <h3>Critical Security Issues and System Improvements Drive Latest Development Wave</h3>

<p>The OpenClaw community is addressing some significant security vulnerabilities while rolling out key reliability improvements this week. Most notably, <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/10993">critical security flaws have been identified</a> where sub-agents can bypass execution approval mechanisms, potentially allowing unauthorized file operations and command execution. This represents a serious security concern that the team is actively working to resolve.</p>

<p>On the stability front, several important fixes are making their way through the pipeline. The <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10989">/stop command functionality has been enhanced</a> to properly terminate long-running tasks that were previously unresponsive to interruption attempts. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/9049">improvements to subagent error handling</a> should eliminate those frustrating infinite loops that left users without feedback when background processes failed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, exciting new features continue to emerge, including <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/7480">CoreMemories - a hierarchical memory system</a> that promises to give OpenClaw agents better context retention through a local-first, file-backed approach. The authentication system is also getting smarter with <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/8602">automatic OAuth token refresh for Anthropic credentials</a>, reducing friction for users leveraging Claude Code integrations. These developments showcase the project's continued evolution toward more robust, user-friendly AI assistance.</p>

    <h3>Community Highlights</h3>

<p>The OpenClaw community has been incredibly active this week, with numerous contributions addressing critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and feature enhancements. Here's what's been happening across GitHub discussions and pull requests:</p>

<h3>Security & Critical Fixes</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>jisi724</strong> identified a critical vulnerability where sub-agents created via sessions_spawn can bypass exec approval mechanisms when executing commands. This security issue affects both regular commands and safeBins operations, highlighting the importance of community security audits.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>liuy</strong> tackled a user experience issue by implementing immediate termination for long-running tasks via the <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10989">/stop command</a>. This fix resolves situations where users couldn't interrupt lengthy operations like large codebase analysis or image processing.</p>

<h3>Agent System Improvements</h3>

<p>Several contributors focused on enhancing OpenClaw's agent capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>wony2</strong> improved session management by ensuring <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10998">session_status displays</a> read per-session thinking/reasoning levels instead of falling back to agent defaults</li>
<li><strong>maxtongwang</strong> addressed stuck loop scenarios with <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/9049">subagent failure handling</a> and added automatic OAuth token refresh for Anthropic credentials</li>
<li><strong>anotb</strong> fixed a cache-ttl pruning issue that occurred on first load after gateway restarts</li>
</ul>

<h3>UI/UX Enhancements</h3>

<p>The Control UI received attention from <strong>Annaxiebot</strong>, who both identified and fixed an issue where the "Toggle assistant thinking/working output" button wasn't properly hiding tool call blocks. They also added a <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10991">configurable instance name feature</a> for the Control UI title, helping users running multiple OpenClaw instances.</p>

<h3>Major Feature Development</h3>

<p><strong>Itslouisbaby</strong> continues work on the ambitious <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/7480">CoreMemories hierarchical memory system</a>, which has generated 25 comments from community members. This local-first, file-backed memory system promises to revolutionize how OpenClaw handles chat history and context management.</p>

<p>Network infrastructure also saw improvements from <strong>chicagobuss</strong>, who added support for ZeroTier, WireGuard, and generic overlay network bind modes, expanding OpenClaw's deployment flexibility.</p>

<h3>Provider & Model Updates</h3>

<p><strong>jatinb92</strong> addressed a model catalog mismatch in the Google Gemini provider, ensuring OpenClaw supports the latest gemini-2.5-flash-lite model that's available through Gemini CLI.</p>

<h3>Bug Reports & Community Feedback</h3>

<p>The community actively reported several important issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Browser automation reliability concerns from <strong>normanlove222</strong> regarding CDP timeouts</li>
<li>Channel-specific issues including Feishu token problems and Slack command registration</li>
<li>Model provider edge cases with qwen-portal and kimi-code models</li>
</ul>

<p>This week's activity demonstrates the OpenClaw community's commitment to security, reliability, and user experience. The diversity of contributions—from critical security fixes to UI improvements—shows how collaborative development strengthens the project for all users.</p>

    <h3>Recent Press Coverage: OpenClaw in the Spotlight</h3>

<p>The OpenClaw project continues to generate significant attention across tech media platforms, with developers and industry observers closely following our progress and contributing valuable insights to the community.</p>

<h3>Developer Deep Dives</h3>

<p>On Medium, developer <strong>Arsalan Shah</strong> published a detailed technical analysis titled <a href="https://medium.com/@iarsalanshah/your-openclaw-agent-is-blind-to-x-com-heres-the-fix-e721b194b86a?source=rss------openclaw-5">"Your OpenClaw Agent Is Blind to X.com Here's the Fix"</a> that addresses a critical integration challenge many users have encountered. The article explores how OpenClaw agents are currently experiencing limitations when interacting with X.com (formerly Twitter), and provides practical solutions for developers looking to enhance their agents' social media capabilities.</p>

<p>Shah's piece highlights both the power and current limitations of OpenClaw agents, demonstrating the kind of real-world problem-solving that makes our open-source community so valuable. The article has sparked discussions about improving OpenClaw's web scraping and API integration capabilities.</p>

<h3>Community Engagement</h3>

<p>This coverage reflects the growing ecosystem of developers who are not only using OpenClaw but actively contributing to solving its challenges. The fact that community members are publishing detailed technical solutions shows the maturity and engagement of our 170k+ GitHub community.</p>

<p>We encourage all users experiencing similar integration challenges to check out Shah's solution and contribute their own findings to help make OpenClaw even more robust for everyone.</p>
